Nomad transforming chassis can change the footprint of the vehicle
by using its linkages.

It can expand its wheel base from a stowed 
to a deployed position with the help of the actuators and connecting
rods.
This helps to change the wheel positions with respect to the chassis base.

The special feature of this particular design is that all four wheels can
stand straightly at any given position because of the two actuators.
